* Reworked Ruby installs:
  * Replaced install-rubys.sh with install-ruby.sh, a script that installs the Ruby version passed as a parameter.
  * Each Ruby install is now a separate layer.
* Updated the README file.
  * Fixed grammar and typos.
  * Now explicitly installs the packages RVM requires to compile Ruby from source.
